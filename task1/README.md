TASK 1
=====================================



### Description
Task 1
Instead of spending money at cinema tickets this holiday you have decided to invite all your friends to your personal cinema. You have hastily decorated the sitting room with a lot of chairs and now you only need a booking system so that your friends can book a chair for the opening night.
You have placed the chairs in three rows with five chairs in each row (see Figure 1).
Figure 1 - Cinema layout
Create the program according to the following requirements:
1) Use a multidimensional array to represent the sitting room. Make sure the array is 3x5 (rows x cols) and that it can store boolean values.
2) Create a menu that has two options. The first option is to book a seat and the second option is to view the currently booked seats.
3) If the user choses to book a seat, a message shall be printed to the screen asking the user to enter the row and column to book. The row shall be read as a number from 1 to 3 and the column shall be read as a number from 1 to 5. Write a message to the screen telling the user if the seat has already been booked by someone else or if the booking was successful. Do not forget to mark the seat as booked.
4) If the user choses to view the bookings a graphical representation of the sitting room shall be printed to the screen. The booked seats shall be represented by an O and all other seats with a . (dot). The output shall also contain a tag <TV> to indicate where the TV is placed. See the video for an example.
5) After having booked a seat or viewed the current bookings the user shall be returned to the menu so that the user can make another choice.
6) The program shall not have an exit option (infinite loop).
The program must use at least:
• One class (the main class)
• A multidimensional array
• A loop
• An if-statement
