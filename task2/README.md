TASK 2
=====================================



### Description

Around Christmas time people often send Christmas cards to their friends and family. You have decided to create a program that can keep track of the cards you receive this year. You want to keep track of the different types of cards you receive. Even if you do not know all the different types of cards you will receive, you will start by adding one type.
Create the program according to the following requirements:
1) Create a class names Card that has only one instance variable, a String that stores the senders name. The name shall be sent as a parameter to the constructor and it shall be accessible via a getter method.
2) Create a class to represent hand drawn cards, call it HandDrawn. The class shall inherit from the Card class and shall have one more instance variable called niceDrawing. The instance variable shall be a boolean, shall be sent as a parameter to the constructor and it shall also be possible to both get the value and to set a new value.
3) Create an ArrayList of cards where you can store any card type. This means that the list shall not only store cards from the HandDrawn class but also any other cards that are subclasses to the Card class.
4) Create two HandDrawn objects using the data from Table 1.
Table 1 - Card data senderName niceDrawing
Anna
True
Kalle
False
5) Add the two objects to the ArrayList.
6) Create a method that takes the list of cards as a parameter and prints all the cards to the screen. Each card shall print all stored information.
7) Use the newly created method to print all the cards. Use the ArrayList of Card objects as a parameter.
The program must use at least:
• Three classes (main + two others)
• An ArrayList
• Inheritance
• Two objects
• A method in the main class taking an ArrayList as parameter
